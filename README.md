Multiplayer browser game based on idea of Towerfall Ascension, implemented using Phaser, WebSockets

## TODO

- [ ] Design the minimum functionality:

  1. Multiplayer
  2. Different sprite for each player
  3. Side screen with all players (box containing player's information [nr. of arrows, points])
  4. Game mode: TimeAttack / Points
  5. Bonuses (treasure): More arrows
  6. 3 States: `Start Game`, `Game`, `End Game`
  7. Low light (simulate towerfall light conditions)

- [ ] Select maximum limit of players for multiplayer
- [ ] Choose sprites for players
- [ ] Find sprites for arrow
- [ ] Find game map + Create
- [ ] Add sounds
- [ ] Add more Bonuses: Wings (maybe?!?!)... TBA
