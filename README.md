## TODO
- [ ] Design the minimum functionality: 
    1. Multiplayer
    2. Different sprite for each player
    3. Side screen with all players (box containing player's information [nr. of arrows, points])
    4. Game mode: TimeAttack / Points
    5. Bonuses (treasure): More arrows
    6. 3 States: `Start Game`, `Game`, `End Game`
    7. Low light (simulate towerfall light conditions)

- [ ] Select maximum limit of players for multiplayer 
- [ ] Choose sprites for players
- [ ] Find sprites for arrow
- [ ] Find game map + Create
- [ ] Add sounds
- [ ] Add more Bonuses: Wings (maybe?!?!)... TBA
